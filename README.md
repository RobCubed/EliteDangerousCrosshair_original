EliteDangerousCrosshair
=======================

Crosshair for Elite Dangerous to assist with piloting in Frameshift Mode


Work in progress. ONLY works with Windowed mode. Does not hook into the DX at all, simply overlays a transparent click-through frame over your entire screen, and detects the location of the game window.

This does function entirely. Written using Visual Studio 2013 Community Edition, should compile fine in there.
