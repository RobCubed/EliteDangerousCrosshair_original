EliteDangerousCrosshair
=======================

Crosshair for Elite Dangerous to assist with piloting in Frameshift Mode


Work in progress. ONLY works with Windowed mode. Does not hook into the DX at all, simply overlays a transparent click-through frame over your entire screen, and detects the location of the game window.

bufferedPanel._programFocus should be set to 'true' for it to function, it currently is not. (WIP for detecting program opening/closing)
